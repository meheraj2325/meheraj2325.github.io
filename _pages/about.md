Hi, there!

I’m Meheraj Hossain, a CSE graduate from the <a href="https://www.du.ac.bd/body/CSE">University of Dhaka</a>, Bangladesh. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href = "https://therapbd.com/">Therap (BD) Ltd</a>, where I develop applications using computer vision models and tools to enhance medical care.

I am also involved as a Part-time Research Assistant at the <a href = "https://ccds.ai/">Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS)</a> where my works are supervised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OqlqQTwAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Amin Ahsan Ali</a>. Here, my current research focuses on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages, particularly Bangla, to improve language understanding and generation in these underrepresented languages.

My research interests lie broadly in the area of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, with a focus on low-resource domains. Specifically, I am interested in:

* **Low-Resource NLP**: Enhancing low-resource languages by leveraging cross-lingual data from high-resource languages.
* **Continual Learning**: Developing strategies to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting LLMs to new domains.
* **Multimodal Learning**: Investigating how different modalities e.g., text and images interact and convey information across them.
* **Applications of LLMs and VLMs**: Exploring the diverse applications of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) across various domains to enhance functionality and user experience.

<strong> I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2025. </strong>
