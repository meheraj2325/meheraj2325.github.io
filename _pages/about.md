Hi, there!
</p>

<p class="justified-text">
I’m Meheraj Hossain, a CSE graduate from the <a href="https://www.du.ac.bd/body/CSE">University of Dhaka</a>, Bangladesh. I am currently working as a Machine Learning Engineer at <a href = "https://therapbd.com/">Therap (BD) Ltd</a>, where I develop applications using computer vision models and tools to enhance medical care.
</p>

<p class="justified-text">
I am also involved as a Part-time Research Assistant at the <a href = "https://ccds.ai/">Center for Computational & Data Sciences (CCDS)</a> where my works are supervised by <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OqlqQTwAAAAJ&hl=en">Dr. Amin Ahsan Ali</a>. Here, my current research focuses on utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for low-resource languages, particularly Bangla, to improve language understanding and generation in these underrepresented languages.
</p>

<p class="justified-text">
My research interests lie broadly in the area of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, with a focus on low-resource domains. Specifically, I am interested in:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <strong>Low-Resource NLP</strong>: Enhancing low-resource languages by leveraging cross-lingual data from high-resource languages. </li>
<li> <strong>Continual Learning</strong>: Developing strategies to prevent catastrophic forgetting when adapting LLMs to new domains.</li>
<li> <strong>Multimodal Learning</strong>: Investigating how different modalities e.g., text and images interact and convey information across them.</li>
<li> <strong>Applications of LLMs and VLMs</strong>: Exploring the diverse applications of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) across various domains to enhance functionality and user experience.</li>
</ul>

<p class="justified-text">
<strong> I am actively seeking Ph.D. opportunities for Fall 2025. </strong> 
</p>
